# ibus-array-spec

openSUSE Tumbleweed ibus-array RPM spec

[ibus-array](https://github.com/lexical/ibus-array)
is a Array 30 engine for iBus.

Patch file engine.patch already merged to upstream.

Add data folder, the cin file is from [array30](https://github.com/gontera/array30).
I modify cin file (should more easy to parse), update script files
and try to update array.db to test.
